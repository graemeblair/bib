	Abstract = {Budget of Realism: 1999 Budget Address 

by

General Abdulsalami Abubakar, Head of State, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria

FELLOW Nigerians, we are once again at the beginning of a new fiscal year, and it is with a deep sense of responsibility that I present to you the budget of the Federal Government for the year 1999. This is a unique budget. It is unique not only because it is the last budget by the military in the administration of our country for one and a half decades, but we have with great realism, taken into serious consideration the hard facts of our peculiar situation and come up with tough decisions on necessary policy actions that would launch our country into genuine economic greatness.

This administration is fully aware that midway through the life of the 1999 budget, the elected representatives of our people will take charge of the affairs of governance of this nation. We have therefore taken extra care to ensure that the incoming civilian administration is neither encumbered nor deluded by our policy decisions. Ours is a realistic budget. Some of the decisions we have taken are hard and they will be painful in the short run. However, in the medium and long-term, the national economy and ourselves would be better off.

Fiscal 1998 was a year of mixed economic blessings. Our foreign reserves at the end of November 1998 stood at US$7.6 billion. The year witnessed some measure of macro economic stability and consolidation of the economic gains attained in 1996 and 1997.

Significant progress was also recorded in implementing economic reforms. These include the removal of restrictions on competition as well as private sector participation in various sectors of the economy. Additional measures to address financial sector distress were adopted.

However, the economy suffered some set-backs which adversely affected the implementation of the 1998 budget and the realisation of the set targets. The global decline in the international crude oil prices, the reduction in our OPEC quota and the temporary closure of oil wells in the Niger-Delta led to a sharp reduction in government foreign exchange earnings from crude oil.

Consequently, the budgeted 1998 revenue of N216.336 billion from oil could not be realised. Indeed, by October 31, 1998, actual receipts from crude oil amounted to only N134.44 billion. Besides the decline in oil revenues, overall economic performance, including real sector growth, was stultified by erratic supply of petroleum products, epileptic power supply situation and persistent crumbling infrastructure. These diminished the potential for raising non-oil revenues.

As a result of the decline in revenues, government effected a downward revision of the 1998 budget in October in order to avert major macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances. Our economic fortunes and experiences have once again exposed the major weaknesses of the Nigerian economy. The over reliance on oil as a source of government revenues and foreign exchange earnings, coupled with weak, import-dependent industrial base as well as low productivity in the agricultural sector rendered the economy extremely vulnerable to fiscal and macro economic imbalances. A major development goal for the country, therefore, is to diversify the productive, foreign exchange and revenue base of the economy. The National Rolling Plan for 1999-2001 and the budget for 1999 provide the basis for achieving this goal.

Outlook for 1999

In 1999, Nigeria will continue to face enormous challenges in its efforts to revive economic growth and improve living conditions. The downturn in the world oil market will result in large revenue and foreign exchange shortfalls which will in turn put pressure on the external, fiscal and financial situation of the country. In addition, growth prospects for 1999 will continue to be undermined by persistent structural problems in the economy.

Against the background highlighted above, overall fiscal deficits could reach unsustainable levels of up to N400 billion during the year and GDP growth will fall sharply unless bold corrective measures are undertaken. It is therefore 
imperative for us to respond to the challenges ahead in the context of the 1999 budget.

The National Rolling Plan 1999-2001

The 1999-2001 National Rolling Plan will continue to draw inspirations from the broad goals and objectives of the Vision 2010. Consequently, the main objectives of the 1999-2001 National Rolling Plan, will include the following:

a. Diversification of the productive base of the economy through enhanced capacity utilization in industry, increase agricultural productivity, and accelerated development of the gas and solid minerals sectors;

b. Promotion of sustainable economic growth through achievement of macro-economic, exchange rate and fiscal stability as well as prudent monetary policies;

c. Raising income levels and reduction of the level of unemployment through enhanced economic growth and vigorous implementation of poverty alleviation programmes;

d. Facilitating private sector-led growth through the creation of appropriate enabling environment, institutions, policies as well as legal and regulatory framework.

The focus and policy thrust of the 1999 budget

The main policy objectives, strategies, and programme priorities for the 1999 budget are as follows:

a. Achieving at the minimum, a three per cent overall growth rate of GDP;

b. Establishing institutional, legal and regulatory framework as well as 
policy reforms necessary for economic growth and diversification;

c. Maintaining appropriate fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies with a view to achieving overall macro-economic stability;

d. Eliminating the dual exchange rate regime;

e. Continuing the policy of privatisation of state owned enterprises;

f. Sustaining the single digit inflation rate achieved for most of 1998 fiscal year;

g. Enhancing efforts on capacity building and utilization;

i. Sustaining prudent internal and external debt management systems;

j. Reducing the level of unemployment;

k. Expanding the existing revenue base by exploring new sources of income;

l. Improving the internal security system to create a safe environment; and

m. Developing and rehabilitating physical infrastructure to facilitate investments and economic activity.

Revenue estimates

At the beginning of 1998, the average selling price of crude oil was US$16-17 per barrel.

This dropped steadily during the year and by October 1998, the realisable price was US$12.8 per barrel, while the price for January 1999 deliveries is less than US$11.00 per barrel. In view of the slump in the global oil market, the price of US$9 per barrel has been adopted for the 1999 budget.

Based on an exchange rate of N86 to US$1, the sum of N453.7 billion is estimated to accrue as revenue from oil and gas sources in 1999. Non-oil revenue is estimated at N214 billion, bringing the projected total federally collected revenue from oil and non-oil sources in 1999 to N667.7 billion. Given the change in the exchange rate conversion factor, the estimated expected total revenue for 1999 has dropped in real terms by 54 per cent from its 1998 level. The Federal Government gross revenue for 1999 is therefore projected at N146.7 billion.

EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES

Capital Expenditure

As a result of a very tight revenue profile, a sum of N88 billion has been provided for the Capital Development Programme of the Federal Government, compared with the sum of N122 billion in 1998. The focus of the capital budget is to complete some of the on-going projects such as the Federal Secretariat building, the Legislative Buildings and accommodation for our in-coming elected lawmakers. Some projects in the  agriculture, health, education, roads, water supply and rural electrification sectors will also be implemented.

In order to further consolidate our efforts towards poverty alleviation and the development of the rural sector, the sum of N1 billion has been provided for FEAP in 1999. Similarly, N500 million has been earmarked for the Peoples Bank and the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) for provision of soft loans and support services to cottage and small-scale industries.

Recurrent Budget

a) A provision of N100 billion has been made for personnel emoluments compared with N56 billion for 1998, to cater for the recent increase in public sector salaries and allowances, as well as the additional expenditures on members and staff 
of the National Assembly during the year. The provision for overhead expenditure in 1999 has been maintained at 1998 level of N61 billion. Provision for domestic debt in 1999 amounts to N39.0 billion. In addition, the sum of N1 billion is provided for settlement of debt owed to local contractors that have already been verified by the National Economic Intelligence Committee (NEIC). The total recurrent expenditure for 1999 therefore amounts to N211 billion.

b) The overall fiscal deficit for the Federal Government in 1999 is projected at N34.1 billion, representing 1.05 per cent of projected GDP. This deficit is arrived at after taking into consideration anticipated transfers, including draw-down from our external reserves. This year, the projected deficit has been estimated to avoid creating accounting distortions.

STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES

In 1999 the Federation Account Revenue is estimated at N262.4 billion. The existing allocation formula will be maintained. Therefore, the Federal Government will receive N127.2 billion; States; N63 billion; Local Government Councils: N52.5 billion; the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) N2.6 billion and Special Funds: N17.1 billion.

In 1999, the estimated VAT amount is N50 billion. The projected increase derives from the fact that the base of VAT will be increased by the expansion of VATable items through reduction of the exemption list. New VAT offices will also be opened in the states to enhance collections. In line with the new VAT distribution formula introduced in this budget the actual allocation to the Federal Government will be reduced to N7.5 billion  while that of the states and local governments will accordingly be increased for them to receive N25.0 billion and N17.5 billion respectively.

FISCAL POLICY

Fiscal policy in the last few years has been designed not only to increase revenue but also as an instrument to promote general economic development. This strategy will be reinforced and fine-tuned in 1999 to sharpen the policy instruments 
and enhance their value towards the attainment of set goals and objectives.

In view of the revenue shortfall, all tiers of government must exercise greater budgetary discipline and concentrate their efforts at enhancing internally generated revenue.

REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMS & EXCISE TARIFF

Since the last tariff adjustment, many manufacturers have made representations on the adverse effects of some of the tariff measures and requested for further adjustments. 
 

 

Consequently, government has approved some adjustments to the customs and excise tariff. Government has also approved the restoration of excise duty on some items such as spirits, cigarettes, tobacco and their derivatives. In addition, a review of the import and export prohibition policies will be undertaken.

In the same vein, with effect from January 1, 1999, Government hereby abolishes the 25 per cent import duty rebate introduced in August 1995 because after three and a half years of application, it can hardly be justified. Similarly, requests for non-statutory exemption from the payment of import duty will henceforth no longer be entertained.

Government appreciates that a number of industries are under considerable pressure from cheap imports which, it is suspected are being dumped in Nigeria. The Ministry of Finance will meet with concerned interest groups at the beginning of the year to discuss ways of addressing this issue. Meanwhile, an anti-dumping committee will be set up soon in the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism. This Committee is to handle cases and complaints relating to dumping, issues of subsidies and countervailing measures to protect Nigeria against unfair trade practices.

EXPORT PROMOTION AND INCENTIVE SCHEMES

Government will continue to implement and streamline existing export incentive schemes and render them more effective.

The various schemes and funds are being merged into a new Manufacture-in-Bond Scheme under which payment of cash incentives to exporters would be replaced with the introduction of Negotiable Duty Credit Certificates (NDCs). In addition to the above incentives, government hereby abolishes the prohibition list in order to encourage competitive pricing and to increase the income of the farmer.

ECOWAS TRADE LIBERALIZATION SCHEME

Nigerian enterprises will be encouraged in 1999 to take full advantage of the protocol on ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (TLS) which provides for the elimination of trade barriers including taxes and levies. Adequate arrangements will be made to ensure that the implementation of the scheme will not adversely affect our manufactured products.

PORT REFORMS

Government in 1996 introduced some reforms at the ports. These included the expansion of mandatory pre-shipment inspection to cover all imports destined for Nigeria irrespective of value and the source of funding. In addition, the reforms provided for the involvement of Professional Import Duty Administrators (PIDA) in the cargo clearance process.

The services of these Administrators, however, will cease with effect from June 30th, 1999.

Problems have arisen in relating to the proliferation of too many agencies in the ports, which has constituted another bureaucratic bottleneck. Accordingly, only the following agencies will henceforth be retained at the ports under the overall supervision of the Nigerian Ports Authority:

a. Nigeria Customs Service 
b. The Ports Police 
c. Nigeria Immigration Service and 
d. Authorized Agents

Where the attention of a specialized agency such as SSS, NDLEA, or Plant Quarantine is required, they would be called from their offices within the Ports. These measures are required to make our ports more attractive to importers and instill sanity. Furthermore, facilities at the ports will be upgraded and modernized through the provision of new equipment and software.

Similarly, at the airports only the Customs and Immigration will be retained, under the general supervision of the Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). Accordingly, security at our airports will be provided by FAAN.

PRE-SHIPMENT INSPECTION

Government has approved the replacement of pre-shipment inspection with destination inspection with effect from April 1, 1999. It has also approved that the services of pre-shipment export agents will cease with effect from April 1, 1999.

TAX POLICY

The tax policy measures in 1998 will continue in 1999. Given the current trends in global oil prices, measures that will ensure efficient tax administration in the country are essential in order to raise higher revenues from the non-oil tax resources. In 1999, efforts of government will be geared towards widening the VAT base through gradual phasing out of VAT exemptions and intensifying collection of all due taxes. Government will at the same time strengthen the tax authorities to be more effective in the collection of taxes from both individual and corporate taxpayers.

a. Review of VAT Sharing Ratio. For State Governments to prosecute basic projects having greater impact on the lives of people at the grassroots, the present VAT sharing formula is to be adjusted in favour of the States and Local Governments.

b. Incentives to the Oil and Gas Industry. The approved tax incentives in the 1997 and 1998 for the exploitation and utilization of associated gas are to continue in 1999. Most of the earlier incentives have been promulgated into laws. In 1999, all the incentives approved by government will be signed into laws to facilitate a stable tax regime in the country for investors.

c. Production Sharing Contract (PSC). From 1999, all oil operators who signed the PSC Agreements for deep offshore oil exploration production with the Government in 1993 are to claim Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allowance as tax offset in accordance with the various agreements, until the contracts terminate. The NNPC is to compile a list of such 
companies for the Federal Inland Revenue Service to implement. However, such concession will not be extended to new contracts.

In addition, interest incurred on inter-company loans obtained under terms prevailing in the open market are to qualify as allowable deduction in arriving at taxable petroleum profits.

a) Tax Treaties:- To consolidate the extensive tax incentives to foreign investors, Government will continue with the policy of concluding Double Taxation Agreements (DTA) with our trading partners who indicate their interest in 1999.

Further, as a concession to our treaty partners, government has approved a lower treaty rate of 7.5 per cent on dividends, interests, rent, and royalties when paid to a bona-fide 
beneficial owner of a treaty country.

b) Joint Venture Cash Calls:- Crude oil sales will continue to be our major source of revenue until the national economy is diversified. The funding of petroleum operations is therefore essential.

However, in the light of the poor state of our finances, government is currently exploring alternative sources of funding the government shares of the Joint Venture operations with a view to solving the cash call problem permanently. In the same vein, government will consider raising project-tied financing in respect of Joint Venture Projects aimed at encouraging exports in the oil and gas sectors of the economy.

c) Incentives to Gas Sub Sector:- In 1998, Government invested US$300 billion as part of its capital contribution in the third train of the Liquefied Natural Gas project. Generous tax incentives have been given to companies that carry out the exploitation of natural gas and utilize the associated gas for commercial purposes. The incentives will continue in 
1999 while details of additional incentives will be provided.

SOLID MINERALS SECTOR

This Administration strongly believes that if proper attention is given to the solid minerals sector, it is capable of generating substantial revenue and employment to supplement those derivable from the oil and non-oil sectors. In 1998 government approved the new Solid Mineral Policy. It also revised laws and regulations to make the sector competitive with those of other mineral-based economies as well as provide generous incentives for prospective investors.

In 1999, Government will continue to attach emphasis to this sector through exploring possibilities for Joint Venture programmes, production sharing and other strategic investments between Nigerian Mining Corporation and Private Investors to facilitate the exploration and exploitation of the country's mineral deposits.

Government has no resources to continuously subsidize inefficient and loss making parastatals. Privatizing such investments has now become a cornerstone of government policy. In pursuing its privatization objectives, government has instituted procedures that are transport to ensure maximum return in the disposal of its assets.

A decree shall be promulgated expeditiously to give legal backing to the privatization programme. Work on the regulatory framework and institutions will also be accelerated. Competition and Deregulation. In 1998, Government repealed and amended 11 legislation that hitherto inhibited competition or conferred monopoly on public enterprises in petroleum, telecommunications, power and mineral sectors.

To further consollidate this policy, government has licensed a few private telecommunication companies. Government is 
encouraged by the response of the private sector so far to this policy reform. Our statutes are still being reviewed with the aim of elimination completely all outstanding sectors constraining competition in other sectors.

Elimination of Dual exchange rate

The application of the dual exchange rate continues to cause distortions in the economy and offers considerable incentive for round-tripping in our foreign exchange operations. Whereas, public expenditure is transacted at the autonomous rate, revenue is monetised at official rate giving rise to a mis-match between revenue and expenditure.

Moreover, economic viability of projects funded at official rate cannot be properly evaluated and may this encourage unprofitable projects. Abolition of the official exchange will remove a long-standing opportunity for personal gain at the expense of the public purse. Accordingly, the official exchange rate is hereby abolished with effect from 1st January, 1999.

Monetary and Credit policy

The focus of monetary policy during 1999 will remain the maintenance of price stability while at the same time accommodating government's efforts to stimulate output growth. The growth of monetary and credit aggregates will be contained at levels that will guarantee single digit inflation rate. The promotion of the stability of the exchange rate will also be a policy focus.

The CBN will continue to rely on treasury bill sales at market-determined, competitive interest rates, while the range of instruments available for mopping up excess liquidity in the system will be broadened to include issuance of development stocks and national savings certificates.

Government is concerned about the widening gap between savings, deposits and lending rates of Commercial and Merchant Banks. The Central Bank has been directed to discuss with the banks on how to narrow the margin so as to impact positively on bank customers.

Government will provide incentives to banks in 1999 to encourage the provision of medium and long-term facilities to the agricultural and solid minerals sectors as well as to small and medium enterprises. This will assist in the diversification of the economy and the development of non-oil sector in general.

Transfer of Commercial Banking functions from the CBN to Commercial/Merchant Banks

Government has directed that the commercial banking functions presently performed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) be transferred to Commercial and Merchant Banks by the end of March, 1999. Ministries and Parastatals will be free to negotiate and reach agreement with Commercial and Merchant Banks subject to the usual clearance with the 
office of the Accountant General of the Federation.

Conversion of Merchant Banks to Commercial Banks

Government has decided that any merchant bank that so wishes may convert to a commercial bank. This measure is being taken to remove the obvious disabilities presently suffered by merchant banks, especially as the equity base of the two types of banks is now the same. It will also help to deepen banking habits in the country. The CBN will publish the conditions and detailed guidelines for the conversion soon.

Restoration of CBN Autonomy

In recognition of the critical role which an independent central bank can play in the maintenance of price stability and sound economic management the government, after due consideration, has decided to grant the CBN autonomy in the formulation and implementation of monetary policies. The government is convinced that an independent CBN would serve the best interest of our national economy. The relevant law has already been amended.

Capital Market Reform:  Government is fully convinced about the need for effective institutional arrangements that will engender stable and strong financial systems. Consequently a number of measures will be taken in 1999 pursuant to the on-going capital market reform, to strengthen the market infrastructure.

The Investment and Securities Decree, which will transform the Securities and Exchange Commission into a bigger, stronger and a more effective institution, will be finalized. Efforts will also be continued to ensure the early take-off of the Abuja Stock Exchange.

External Debt Management:  For a number of years now the 2 billion US Dollars usually set aside for servicing Nigeria's external debt has fallen below the requirement of our creditors. Even though this practice has resulted in the accumulation of substantial arrears, Government is only able to earmark the sum of 1.5 billion US Dollars for external debt service this year, due to resource constraints in 1999. It has therefore become imperative for us to explore options for reducing our debt service payments to affordable and sustainable levels.

Accordingly, efforts will be intensified to open up negotiations with the Paris Club, Bretton Woods Institutions and other creditors to seek debt reduction and debt relief. The Ministry of Finance will pursue vigorously the achievement of this 
goal. We have initiated discussion with the Bretton Woods institutions and the Secretariat of the Paris Club towards evolving a programme aimed at eventually attaining debt relief for the country. Government will also continue with the 
debt conversion programme as a vehicle for debt reduction and investment promotion.

Embargo on external loans

In view of the projected deficit in the 1999 budget, there is a need for government to broaden the source of funding in order to close the financial gap in the budget. Accordingly, government has lifted the 1994 embargo placed on external borrowing particularly with respect to concessionary and project-tied loans and credits. Furthermore, financing of export-based projects, based on the assets and revenue flows of the enterprise, especially in the gas and oil sectors, will be considered.

Petroleum products pricing and supply

The acute nationwide shortage of petroleum products in the country has become a cause of great concern to the nation.

Public sector monopoly of petroleum products supply, along with the unscrupulous acts of unpatriotic citizens, has been the major contributory factor to the shortages.

To ensure a lasting solution to the problem, the importation of petroleum products has been deregulated. Government has also allocated sizeable amounts of funds for the turn-around maintenance and rehabilitation of the Kaduna, Port Harcourt and Warri refineries.

Government is not unaware of the reaction of our people to the recent increase in the price of petroleum products by the oil marketers. Government is thus encouraging the petroleum marketers to enter into discussions with consumer representatives with a view to moderating the prices to sustainable levels.

Priority projects

A comprehensive list of priority projects is being compiled. The debt  component of these projects will be reviewed with a view to restructuring and rescheduling it in line with our cash flow realities.

Wage increase

About three months ago the Federal Government approved wage increases for public servants and directed state and local governments to negotiate appropriate wage adjustments with their respective employees, based on their financial strengths. Regrettably, with the dwindling government revenues caused by a sharp fall in oil prices, the payment of the recommended wage package has become insupportable and unsustainable for the federal, state and local governments.

As it is not our intention to bequeath the incoming civilian administration with unmanageable economic problems, we are compelled to review the wage increase to affordable and sustainable levels. In this regard, government has entered 
into discussions with the labour unions with a view to arriving at acceptable wage levels.

Foreign Policy

This Administration will continue, in 1999, to pursue its policy of constructive engagement with other members of the international community. We are committed to ensuring that Nigeria takes its rightful place among the comity of nations 
based on the principles of mutual respect and protection of our national interests. During the course of 1998, the international community responded positively to our posture of reaching out in accordance with these principles. We appreciate such warm responses and support, and hope the international community will continue to support Nigeria at 
this crucial stage of our history not only in ensuring the successful implementation of our political transition but also our economic reform programmes.

The global economic recession we are all witnessing of recent in many parts of the world calls for serious concern. Nigeria belongs to an integrated, inter-linked world economy. Given the already existing structural weaknesses of our national economy, we are not immune to the problems ravaging national economies in other parts of the world. To reduce our vulnerability, Nigeria requires substantial capital inflow to complement domestic resources in order to revamp the economy.

Government would, therefore, vigorously pursue economic diplomacy to mobilize the support of the international community for Nigeria's policy reform. This would enable the country to attract foreign investments as well as provide the enabling environment for a more favourable consideration for Nigeria's request for external debt relief. Bilateral 
talks between Nigeria and other countries and multi-lateral institutions will also emphasize the issue of trade and development.

National Honours and Awards

This year, government has decided to resuscitate the tradition of conferring National Honours and Awards which has been suspended since 1984. The National Honours and Awards is to honour deserving Nigerians, who have rendered special and outstanding services in their various fields of specialization to the benefit and progress of the nation. As a result of the long break, over 750 recipients will be honoured. The award will be conferred during the early part of the year. It is our hope that the revival of this tradition will motivate the nation's citizens to greater accomplishment.

Democratization programme

I am happy to note that the democratization programme has been on course. The success of the local government elections and the enthusiasm that Nigerians exhibited in choosing those to govern them demonstrate the efficacy of the democratization programme.

The Report of the Constitution Debate Coordinating Committee has been submitted to Government on schedule.

Government will review this report and take a decision on the Committee's submission early in the year. As the military prepares to hand-over the reigns of governance on May 29, 1999, I urge all of us to join hands in ensuring the success of the remaining elections. I once again call on our politicians to play the game according to the rules and eschew the politics of bitterness and unnecessary accusations.

Governance

This administration has repeatedly stressed its determination to combat corruption and improve the governance of our nation. This reflects our firm belief that sound macro-economic policies and structural reforms alone will not be enough 
to put Nigeria on the path of sustainable growth. We must, therefore, also tackle the pervasive corruption and the deterioration in the rule of law which stand in the way of a great nation.

It is in this light that the funding of the Judiciary and the Nigeria Police Force will be enhanced to adequate and sustainable levels. The administration has also approved the appointment of additional Justices of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal, while their retirement age and that of Chief Judges of the State High Courts has been extended to 70 years. 

Budgetary and national discipline

My dear country men and women, let me at this juncture draw your attention to the sacrifice and discipline required for the successful implementation of the 1999 budget. Given the uncertain and dwindling nature of our revenue from oil upon which we are heavily dependent, there must be great prudence in government expenditures. Public officers in ministries and extra-ministerial departments must ensure that expenditures are incurred for only essential purposes, in order to control overhead costs. The Ministry of Finance, in conjunction with the Office of Secretary to the Government of the Federation will put in place necessary measures to control costs and wasteful expenditures. This calls for cooperation and sacrifice on the part of all government employees.

This administration is, of course, fully aware of the sacrifices already being made by its workers. Indeed, we are painfully aware of the sacrifices all Nigerians have been making these past years. This is why we are anxious to put in place policy measures designed to bring long-lasting relief to our citizens.

Unfortunately, however, as in treating malignant diseases, curative measures bring pain first before the desired relief. Our economy has long been in a malignant state. We do urge our fellow countrymen to appreciate this. We are confident that before long, our remedial policy actions would bring relief to our homes.

This administration is also aware of the dissatisfaction among certain segments of our population arising from certain government actions or inactions in the past. Genuine as such grievances may be, we cannot allow the continued reckless expression of such feelings. The developments in the oil producing areas of Niger-Delta region is a case in point. While we appreciate the feelings of the people in the area over their sad condition, this administration notes with great displeasure the disruptions of the activities of oil companies government and private enterprises by rampaging youths.

Seizure of oil wells, rigs and platforms as well as hostage-taking and vehicular-hijacking, all in the name of expressing grievances are totally unacceptable to this administration. We are no doubt committed to freedom of expression, the right to dissent, and all other basic freedoms and rights that are the hallmarks of a decent, civilized open society. The recent activities in the Niger-Delta region are a flagrant abuse of our commitment to such rights and freedoms. This administration will not allow lawlessness and anarchy to camouflage as right or freedom. We will not accept brazen challenge to the State authority under threat of violence as recently happened in the Niger-Delta region. Government has a responsibility to safeguard the State and the security of life and property of all its citizens and those of foreign nations on our soil carrying out their legitimate pre-occupations.

This administration is resolved to do just that.

I will, therefore appeal to all those that have been engaged in the unacceptable excesses of the recent past in the region to stop such actions henceforth, in the interest of peace and decency. This administration is convinced that the Niger-Delta region stands to reap tremendous dividend by dissent through dialogue rather than dissent through violence Such is the path to a civilized and great society which we are all striving to build.

Conclusion

Finally, I must express sincere and heartfelt appreciation to all and sundry for the very warm support and cooperation they have accorded this administration since our assumption of office last June. This has constituted the bedrock upon which the success of the democratization programme has been constructed. It is my hope and expectation that we can continue to rely on your goodwill, support and prayers as we march towards the emergence of democratic governance in the country.

I wish you a happy and prosperous 1999 and a happy Eid el-Fitr in advance.

Thank you and God bless us all.

@unpublished{Abubakar:1998,
	Abstract = {Text of address delivered by Head of State, Commander-in- Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, General Abdulsalami A. Abubakar, at the World Press Conference in Abuja on Monday, 7 September 1998:

Gentlemen of the Press,

1. I am delighted to meet with the world press for the first time since I took over the leadership of our great country. I would like to use this medium to highlight our attempts at moving Nigeria forward in the social, political and economic arena.

2. This administration began its short life with a few clear objectives and policy thrusts. The design and implementation of a transparent, all-inclusive democratisation programme within the shortest possible time was the most paramount. Restoring accountability and due process in public life  in the civil service, the judiciary and the

citizenry, was essential if Nigeria was to achieve its fullest potentials. Finally, the administration had to engender an economic environment that attracts investment, creates employment and increases incomes.

3. Accordingly, the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), was unanimous that our policy thrusts in the political, economic and administrative arenas were to be few and focused, and derive from the foregoing objectives. I will dwell on these thrusts throughout this briefing.

4. Our democratisation programme began in earnest with the inauguration of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 11 August 1998. The enabling decree establishing INEC, the quality and integrity of its chairman and members, as well as its approach to the assignment so far confirm our resolve to implement a transparent, all- inclusive political process. This administration is committed to sustaining the independence and transparency of INEC.

5. The draft constitution presented by the National Constitutional Conference in 1995 has been published and will be ready for wide circulation in due course. All comments and views arising from the public will be presented to the PRC for consideration prior to promulgation.

6. The commitment of this administration to human rights has been amply demonstrated by the release of political detainees, granting of pardon to some convicted persons and the withdrawal of charges against others. The general level of individual freedom, freedoms of expression and association, among others have greatly improved. Cases of people who are detained and have not been arraigned before the courts and some class of persons already convicted for offences are being examined and appropriate decision will be taken. Already, the Attorney-General of the Federation, in conjunction with the Minister of Internal Affairs and the National Commission on Human Rights of Nigeria, have zoned the country for the purpose of accelerating the decongestion of prisons.

7. We wish to reiterate our call on those Nigerians who are currently on self-exile to return and join in our efforts towards democratisation and the economic renaissance of our country. With our quest towards the improvement of our socio-economic infrastructure and climate for governance, we will conduct a census of Nigerian professionals and those with special talents currently excelling worldwide with a view to harnessing the country's entire human resources.

8. We have also tried to run an open government that is closer to our people. Our new team of military administrators and ministers reflect the competence, integrity and diversity with which God has amply endowed our nation. We have made conscious efforts, to bring on-board, good men and women to pilot the affairs of our states and our ministries. I am confident that they will all live up to our expectations.

9. I have also visited all our military formations to re-confirm the commitment of the Armed Forces and Police to the democratisation programme. The officers and men of the Nigerian Armed Forces and Police, like the generality of our people yearn for democracy in a united and peaceful country. They are overwhelmingly in support of our democratisation programme.

10. The programme announcement by INEC envisages elections to begin in December 1998, and the hand over date of 29 May 1999 remains sacrosanct. We are deeply committed to this date. The party registration guidelines just issued by INEC emphasise the role of the electorate as the ultimate determinant of the existence and success of political parties. This is democracy par excellence, and confirms the confidence of Nigerians in INEC.

11. I have just concluded two visits to South Africa. The first was a state visit on the invitation of President Nelson Mandela. The second was to attend the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. During these visits, I reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to closer, cooperative

relations with South Africa in the promotion of bilateral trade, investment, regional peace and stability and the promotion of a new African renaissance. I also seized the opportunity to restate our commitment to the non-aligned movement as an organisation dedicated to world peace, security and equality of nations.

12. Back home, this administration is committed to instilling transparency, accountability and probity in public life. We have therefore been engaged in investigating the conduct of certain departments of government in the disbursement and application of public funds. It is time to put the speculations to rest.

13. I can confirm that routine audit and investigations of various accounts in the office of the national security departments and agencies are on-going. This audit/investigations are being conducted by the office of the National Security Adviser and are designed to recover monies which fall into the following categories:

a. Amounts advanced for contracts which have not been executed;

b. Amounts advanced for contracts whose prices were over-inflated;

c. Amounts withdrawn for purposes other than either of the above but were not properly applied.

14. These investigations are not formal administrative or judicial inquiries; yet, they have achieved appreciable results. All those that have been questioned have cooperated and voluntarily refunded some monies, which are being kept in a special account in the Central Bank of Nigeria. At the end of the exercise, Government will fully examine all the findings and take appropriate decisions.

15. While we appreciate the vigilance of the press in this matter, it is important that you exercise some sense of responsibility and check your facts before publication.

16. With a cabinet in place, our economic revitalisation programme will now commence in earnest. Central to this is the reorganisation of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the NNPC. The reorganisation is aimed at reducing the span of control in the NNPC, creating an independent commission to regulate and monitor the petroleum sector, and the appointment of a Special Adviser on Energy who will coordinate the activities of the NNPC and the independent commission. Our objective is to make the sector more effective and responsive to the needs of the Nigerian economy. In the meantime, I will maintain oversight of the Ministry, while the permanent- secretary will be responsible for day-to- day administration of its activities.

17. Another major plank of our economic programme is the liberalisation of the Nigerian economy to attract foreign and domestic investment. Accordingly, we are going to repeal the laws inhibiting competition in every economic sector Concurrently, we shall entrench a transparent regulatory framework for competition and non-discrimination in all sectors of the economy before the end of this year.

The implementation of our privatisation and commercialisation programme will soon begin with the promulgation of its enabling decree. The framework will be transparent and based on competitive bidding for equity stake and management control of major public enterprises. We intent to partially control of major public enterprises whose performances have had negative impact on the well-being and economic growth of our nation.

19. This administration therefore invites the international community and Nigerians to come and participate in our privatisation programme. We also invite international investment banks, commercial banks, export credit agencies and management consultants to work with us in our liberalisation of markets, deregulation and privatisation.

20. Our invitation to the international community is not limited to the privatisation programme. We also invite the international business community to take advantage of the infrastructure available and the incentives provided at the Calabar Export Processing Zone to invest in export-oriented industries that enjoy comparative advantage using

primary raw materials in Nigeria.

21. In the light of these efforts, we urge our creditors to take cognisance of our reforms and the unique problems facing our nation at this time to grant us debt relief.

22. Efforts are under way to address the shortage of petroleum products that have plagued the nation for some time. The rehabilitation of our refining, reception, storage and distribution facilities continues with urgency.

23. We are disturbed by the current rate of disruptions of the operations of the oil companies. These have degenerated to kidnapping, extortion and wilful damage to pipelines and facilities. However, we are sensitive to the agitation of the inhabitants of the oil-producing areas for a better standard of living. The Chief of Air- Staff, and a member of the PRC, Air Vice-Marshal Nsikak Eduok, is the chairman of a committee established to reorganise OMPADEC. The objective of the restructuring is to make OMPADEC more responsive to the needs of the oil-producing communities.

24. The Committee has already submitted its report; thus, a new OMPADEC will be in place soon. The new OMPADEC will be adequately funded to provide much-needed basic facilities to the oil-producing communities. In the meantime, we appeal to the oil companies to intensify their community interaction and development activities in these areas. We also appeal to the communities to cooperate with the oil companies and government to improve the living conditions of the people. Government will not tolerate any acts of lawlessness by youths and others in these areas.

25. On foreign relations, our policy goals remain unchanged. This administration will consolidate old friendships, win new ones and repair damaged relations. We will continue to contribute to global peace, regional security and stability in the ECOWAS and the world in general.

26. This administration has enjoyed and appreciates the remarkable goodwill and patience of Nigerians and the international community from its inception. Gentlemen of the press have been particularly supportive and objective in your assessment of our modest efforts at national renewal. I wish to seize this opportunity to thank you, fellow Nigerians and the world at large, for your support. It is my intention to continue this and similar interactions with the media to foster understanding of our programmes. We welcome your constructive criticism to enable adjustments and corrections to be made in the overall interest of moving our nation forward. Nigerians deserve nothing less.

27. Thank you very much.},

@article{Etaghene:2000,
	Annote = {Nothing fits the coming into being of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) more succinctly than the aphorism "better late than never." Its passage has been anything but protracted, rough, cumbersome and sometimes rocky. This view becomes more revealing if one looks back on the acknowledgment that it was a campaign promise of President Olusegun Obasanjo in last year's presidential elections.

Within this short period in Nigeria's ever-turbulent socio-economic climate, the NDDC has had its fair share of the country's tribulations and incoherent policies. First was the President's wider perception of the Niger-Delta region. This related to the definition of which states (areas) qualified to belong.

Then came the politics of its funding, mode of appointment of managing director of the commission and other members of the council and the tussle between the executive arm and the National Assembly which divided the right to ratify the President's nominees for offices into the new body. After passage, in both Houses with far reaching amendments, President Olusegun Obasanjo who considered the bill his "pet project" refused to sign it. In his view his action was neither a veto in conclusion or provisionally. He instead directed both the Senate and the House to amend an unimplemented act.

After 30 days as constitutionally stipulated in the Constitution, the National Assembly with over two-third majority passed the bill into an act. This has been over four months. Between the presentation and the passage of the bill much water have passed under the bridge. First was the definition of stakeholders. In this respect most Niger Deltans wanted the retention of Oil Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) while the new commission dealt with the peculiar problems of the Niger Delta minorities whose fears of marginalisation dates back to the colonial era.

It raised many questions as to what the Niger Delta people really wanted. Was it a body to specifically look into these problems or one to address the issues common place to communities which produce oil. The pros and cons were pronounced. People like the Delta State Governor, Chief James Ibori and Chief Harold Dappa-Biriye, Chairman of South-South People's Conference (SSOPEC) came on the side of the resuscitation and strengthening of OMPADEC "as an intervention platform for all the oil producing states."

OMPADEC in their view would still be relevant to the development needs of the region "because it should cater for all the oil producing communities no matter where they were in the country."

The proponents of this approach could have been credited with more clairvoyance because exploration for oil in the country is a continuous exercise but the executive had the dominant position. According to Chief Ibori, "if we remain rigid, we would continue to lose. A solution has to be found for the suffering of our people so we accepted the position of Mr. President." At the end therefore common sense after non-discreeting compromises, the act is on the verge of becoming operational. With the appointment of Godwin Omene as pioneer managing director by the President last week, the real battle which President Olusegun Obasanjo envisaged and loathed will play out at the Assembly hearing and ratification in the coming weeks.

What are the problems these people will face? The history of the peculiar problems of this region though not many leaders of this country would want to address it head-on are legionary and are as long as the Nigerian nation. In the original six states referred to as the South-South geo-political zone, they are all minority groups. They claim perhaps with some justification that the Nigerian State has perpetually dominated and oppressed them. They provide the nation's breadbasket as the providers of our crude oil yet there is pervasive hunger in their hand.

Under development of the area stands out. There is a complete lack of the federal government's presence. The few that were attracted there by sheer natural imperatives like the Delta Steel Complex, Ovwian-Aladja, Nigerian Newsprint Manufacturing Company, Oku-Iboku, et al have died either naturally or due to deliberate negligence.

Hunger is also another characteristic of the region in a land naturally blessed with milk and honey. Within the South-South oil producing zone and Ondo, Imo and Abia states as component parts of the NDDC, there is acute hunger. Direct government policies as palliative measures to address these inadequacies have not for once been embarked upon as the case in Libya, Iran, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, et al. It might be unfair to conclude it has not been done here. The Babangida regime with the OMPADEC experiment attempted an ephemeral policy but it ended up in failure due to poor implementation.

With the presence of the myriads of problems begging for solution, the new commission has a vital role and a goal to accomplish. Cries of lamentations gave rise to the establishment of the commission. So the Obasanjo administration and the National Assembly must have been very careful in outlining the functions of the commission in their march to ameliorating the shortcomings inherent in the Niger Delta region.

For the efficient implementation of those functions, there will be a council made up of 11-member board, one from each of the nine oil producing states. There shall be a managing director and two executive directors who will be appointed by the President. As a consensus or compromise, Delta State has been accepted to produce the managing director being the largest oil producing state. On October 8, 2000, President Olusegun Obasanjo met with the governors of the Niger-Delta and at that meeting some lingering issues of disagreement which had hitherto held back the take-off of the commission were resolved.

Two days later, the governor of Rivers State, Chief Peter Odili led a 26-man delegation to deliberate with the President in Abuja where the issue of the NDDC was raised. After the meeting, Chief Odili was quoted as saying, "we discussed the NDDC Act with the President and I am happy to say that the commencement of the NDDC Act is in fact, round the corner.

The process of implementation has started and I do know authoritatively that the process of the constitution of the board of NDDC has commenced. The process of making things better has started," he concluded.

Governor Peter Odili exuded some degree of optimism sufficient to quell the anxiety of long awaiting people. It was however, then not clear when he stated that "the process of implementation has started." Since Rivers State was picked as the headquarters, a location with comparable office accommodation had been put in place or chosen for long. With the recent announcement, perhaps the process now is in fullest gear.

In Delta State, it has been beyond sheer enthusiasm. There were deep interests and excitement in the battle for the appointment of the managing director. Opinion leaders, commentators and even editorial writers had their share of inputs. Before the President made this announcement, the rumour mill was agog with "news of the potential appointee" for a nation wary of procrastination. President Olusegun Obasanjo on an official visit to the Rivers State last month repeated his oft assurance that the NDDC would take off on October 1, 2000. It came and went without any event.

Dr. Doyin Okupe was the first to fly the kite in July. Then while specifically mentioning six names of candidates who had been screened for the top job assured that "a dark horse" would pick the slot because of much mud slinging by some applicants. We have heard that the list elongated to 20. It was on record that virtually all the major ethnic groups in Delta State sponsored candidates for the top job.

However, the last "rumour" on this was that President Obasanjo was not keen, even not bothered with whether or not the new helmsman for the commission comes from an oil producing community. "The concern," according to a source, "is that such a person must be qualified and could be indigene of any of the oil producing states." Some analysts dismissed this attitude as succumbing to political pressure as it undermined the principle of proximity, zoning and knowledgeability in making crucial appointments. For once, the President really kept the people guessing.},

	Annote = {Lagos --- For so long, echoes from the Niger Delta have reverberated with disturbing noise so much that the arising troubles rough-painted the image of the country as an unstable economy. What with the fightings, kidnappings hostage takings, and even killings.

The understandable angst of the people was sign-posted by the venal acts of the Egbesu Boys, or the Bakassi Boys or under the general classification of Niger Delta youths. Their case: A reversal from the monumental neglect of the legendary hen that lays the golden eggs. They were prepared to bring the nation down on her knees through raw brigandage if that was what it would take to achieve this.

The promises and election of President Olusegun Obasanjo helped to broker some truce. The holiday seemed over last week when the Ijaw Youths warned that if the President does not sign the Niger Delta Bill into law within a given time, they will resume their legendary hostilities.

But beyond that threat, is the fact that the Federal Government has attempted to tow the line of propriety when it recently released the much demanded thirteen per-cent derivation revenue from the federation account.

But now that the funds have been released, will it translate to better life for the long-deprived people of the Niger Delta? Eddy Odivwri reports. Additional reports by Samuel Ajayi

The problem of the Niger Delta got orchestrated, perhaps from an ironic edge. It was in March 1998, when the now quiet Daniel Kanu of the infamous Youths Earnestly Ask for Abacha(YEAA) organised the two-million man march, to sell the illicit impression that the late General Abacha was indeed a popular leader who is the veritable sole-messiah of the moment.

The thirty-six states were ordered to send contingents to Abuja as part of the cheering and clapping fans of the General. The Ijaws from Bayelsa, Delta, Rivers, Ondo, and Akwa-Ibom states were also there.

Coming from the unlit creeks of the Niger Delta, the Ijaw members of the contingent were indeed shocked at the glitter and glitz seen in the Abuja city. They surmised that, "na our money make Abuja fine." The realization of this truth invoked some anger in the youths. Soon as they got back to their base, the true weight and depth of the neglect dawned on them, and ever since that renaissance, the Ijaw Youths have never been the same again.

That marked the beginning of troubles in the creeks .And the Government knew it. The Niger Delta threat was palpable, both to the then coming democracy and also to the economy generally. The world was in agreement that the zone had suffered terrible neglect and deprivation. That fact upped the matter to a cardinal campaign issue for Mr. President. He had promised that he would decisively address, not dress, the problem of the Niger Delta people.

That informed the drafting of the Niger Delta Development Commission bill in August last year.

But while the Bill went through the legislative process, a more crucial matter arose. It was the issue of revenue derivation principle.

The IBORI INITIATIVE

On March 31, the South-South Governors assembled in Asaba, the Delta State capital, on the invitation of the Delta State governor, Chief James Onanefe Ibori. The National Assembly members from the zone were also there. The singular reason was to synergise their political might and influence in demanding for their right to their fair share in the nation's resource, albeit, constitutionally.

In the key-note address presented to the body by Ibori, he had worked on the nerves of the members when he noted that "given the sad and long history of our marginalisation, we should see and treat our various offices as held in sacred trust with corresponding obligations imposed by our conscience and oath of office. "He said it was therefore incumbent on the office-holders to ensure that they worked towards the redemption of their people from the yokes of," selfish exploitation of any form and colour... in whatever form it may be expressed.

Therefore he told the assembly that, "we must speak, when we must, and must act, when it is desirable, in the over-riding interest of our states and the nation."

At the end of the summit, the governors and the legislators did speak with one voice in what has long been known as the Asaba Declaration.

The Ibori-inspired summit had indeed needled the conscience of the Federal Government when he quoted copiously from the nation's constitution to support the fact that the Federal Government was breaching the provisions of the books, as it fails every month, to remit the states their due: 13 per-cent of the revenue accruing from their states.

Ibori stressed that the states were determined to control their resources in such a way that they could reasonably deliver on their electoral promises. The communiqu that came out of the summit drew heavily from the Ibori speech. And it shook the Federal government to its roots.

Three weeks after, the Federal Government announced the release of the 13 per-cent due the states, but with a snag: the due for six months was withheld, and even the ones supposedly released, fell short of the announced sums. The statistics showed that Delta State had the largest share with about N2.3b, while Rivers and Bayelsa had about N1.4b each, Akwa-Ibom got N1.7b, and Ondo got N531,062,010.20m, and Imo--N189,726,835.44m, Cross-River--N173,129.03m and Abia had N105,458,161.65m, while Edo got N43,666,152,45m

In total, the Federal Government released the sum of N7,527,349,154.48b.

WITH The MONEY NOW, WHAT NEXT?

Now that the states have received the said sums or part of it what is the next agenda for them?

With the in-flow of such funds perhaps on a monthly basis henceforth, the affected zones verily have all the reasons to turn their states around for good. Suddenly, perhaps, the agitations within the zone should simmer, if not die.

The angst of the land has been the restlessness and idleness of the youths because of lack of meaningful employment which has brewed choking poverty amongst the people. With such poverty, has come varying degrees of violence and frustrations.

Now, the state Governors have the resources to begin something. Perhaps, projects that can meaningfully keep the youths engaged. If large scale industrial concerns can not be embarked upon now, cottage industries could be suitable alternatives. Beyond that, infrastructural developments are germane.

Indeed, the area reeks with astounding neglect.

In Bayelsa state, for instance, only one tiny two-lane road runs through Yenogoa, the state capital. The few adjoining streets are untarred .What's more, the state is not connected to the national power grid. The state's electricity runs on self-powered gas turbine. Other towns and villages in the state, have very poor road network.

In Delta state, the rural areas are almost cut off from the stream of civilization, within the state. Most towns and communities are in thick darkness just as the poverty level is worrisomely high.

The story is not different in most of the concerned states. The mass of the citizenry wallow in abject poverty. Means of earning a living are either not there, or are destroyed through the seismic effects of oil and gas exploration.

In several cases where oil-spills have been recorded, the flora and fauna of those areas have been greatly affected. The release of the derivation fund should afford the individual state governments the opportunity of paying back the communities through programmes that will assuage their long-rankled nerves.

One way the released funds will touch the lives of a greater chunk of the masses, is to embark on projects that will open up the rural areas, to the beam of government's effect.

NO-GO AREAS FOR The FUND

Given the amounts involved, there is the temptation for the funds to suffer diversion. Indeed the states are at liberty to design or initiate any programme of their choice with the funds the only caveat being that such projects must be visible and feasible.

The urge to embark on white elephant projects that will not immediately be beneficial, should be avoided.

Perhaps a worse use to which the fund could be put is for the governors to begin to appropriate part of the fund in preparation for their next election in 2003. The funds needless to say, should not get into private hands or pockets. The tendency to use the fund to patronise party faithfuls will indeed amount to the abuse of the funds.

Perhaps the state Governments may need to draw a guide from what the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo did with the cocoa proceeds in the old Western Region.

If the south-south Governors supported the clamour for a return to the true federalism, this is the time and opportunity to prove that indeed if the states are in control of their resources development will be faster and more meaningful.

FLASH POINTS OF The MATTER

Outstanding Balance

President Olusegun Obasanjo will go down in history as having obeyed constitutional provisions by giving the states their dues, belatedly or not.

But what perhaps sticks out is the balance of the fund that has been released. The constitution that recommended the thirteen percent derivation sharing formulae came into effect May, last year. Therefore the obedience of the provision should, ipso facto, follow from the date the constitution came into effect; so, May 1999, and not January 2000.

The Federal Government between June and December last year was only giving the states one percent of the funds. So when will the balance of 12 percent be paid?

Furthermore, it was learnt that the whole sums as announced have not been released in full, that only about fifty percent has been released. So when will the balance get to the states?

Similarly, the Federal Government has been withdrawing and keeping the 3 percent usually given to the scrapped OMPADEC. To what use is the Government going to put this money? Or better still, when will Government give it to the concerned states?

Management of the Stake-Holders

No doubt, the seat of the various state governments will witness more pressure now on account of the released funds. The resources are few but the stake holders are many.

One of the notable groups is the traditional rulers in the states. Most of them, in the days of OMPADEC, turned contractors. Many of them are still so. Infact they constituted themselves into a council of formidable pressure group that negotiated expected community benefits with the oil companies. That way, they became a go-between for the communities and the oil companies.

And many of them were accused of short changing the communities, sometimes causing communal disquiet.

The traditional rulers had even argued that they, and not the governors, should be the ones to receive and manage the funds. This thus means that the governors will require good measure of wisdom to handle the traditional rulers.

Local Government Chairmen

Being that they are the heads of the lowest wrung of Government, Local Government Chairmen are also expected to mount some pressure on the disbursement of the fund, as stake holders. As the gate keepers of the rural communities, the Council bosses will need to be wisely integrated in the determination, design and execution of the grass-root projects.

Youth Leaders

These form a crucial group of stake holders given their propensity to spill the beans. The youths must be contained. Programmes and projects must be designed to accommodate them because the quiet and peace among the youths may almost mean peace and calm in the whole zone .Infact the youths should be the centre-piece of the projects.

Sharing Formulae

Just as the federal Government shared the resources according to the proportion of oil yield in the states, in the same way, the states in executing projects across the states must put into consideration the quantity of the contribution of that community in the overall resources of the state which is being expended.

This is not by any means saying that non-oil producing communities should be left out in the development projects. But there should be a scheme designed in such a way that will guarantee fairness in the project distribution format. In Delta state for instance, communities like, Forcados Escravos Ughelli, Ekakpamre, Kokori, Orogun, Ozoro, Igbide etc.., must fairly benefit according to their production capacity.

The IMPERATIVES OF The FUND

The operators of the fund will need to run the fund with transparency. The people should be made to know what projects are being executed with the fund and where.

This will reassure the people that the funds are being put to good use. That thus implies that there is need for accountability.

To suffuse the figures and workings of the fund in the dark alleys of government bureaucracy, is to empower the mill of disaffection. Indeed, such a system has the potential of turning the essence of the fund to an unwanted time bomb which explosion could be fatal.

The time to brighten the creeks and hinterlands is now.},

@article{Elumoye:2000,
	Annote = {Lagos --- A group of Niger Delta youths have given President Olusegun Obasanjo a 30-day ultimatum within which to sign the Niger Delta Development Commission Bill into law or face "unpleasant" consequences.

Rising from a two-day crucial meeting in Warri, Delta State, at the weekend, the Meimbutus in alliance with the other groups operating under the aegis of Niger Delta Izon youths gave Obasanjo up till May 29 to meet their demands or be prepared for the consequences of the failure to comply with the ultimatum.

The demands of the militant group included the immediate constitution of the board of the NDDC.

The group also accused Obasanjo of compounding the problems of the Niger Delta region rather than accelerating the development process of the area.

According to the communique issued at the end of the 'crucial' meeting and signed by Dan Ekpebide, George Timimini and Kenny Orubebe, President, Public Relations Officer and Financial Secretary of the group respectively, the youths also gave a May 29 quit order to all oil companies operating in the Niger Delta area "failure of which they would see hell.

"The Niger Delta Izon youths collegiate leadership is in total support of all the recommendations of the National Assembly on the NDDC and that the National Assembly should not rescind its recommendations therein, particularly those from the core Niger Delta region," the youth added.

According to them, "If Obasanjo thinks that he had succeeded in and will continue to do so after the genocide committed against the people of Odi, then mighty hands of Supreme Egbesu in consultation with the Niger Delta Izon Youths Collegiate leadership will always defend Ijaw ethnic nationality".

The militant youths said they decided to take the hard posture because our patience with President Obasanjo administration has run out moreso as the administration seems to lack ideological focus and direction.

The communique further stated that any unpleasant action taken by them in and around the Niger Delta region to actualise their demand after May 29 should not be blamed on the peace-loving youths of the region, but on the President.

The youths reminded Obasanjo of promises he made during his campaign tours that his administration would open a floodgate of development in the Niger Delta region, The "false promises" were believed by this collegiate Izon youths leadership of the 47 militant youths organisations after consultations with the "Supreme Egbesu."

The aggrieved youths praised the efforts of the National Assembly members who they said meant well for the region, but lamented President Obasanjo's perceived inaction on the NDDC matter.

Meanwhile, Multinational oil firms operating in the country are in a dilemma over fresh threats by the Niger Delta Volunteer Force (NDVF) demanding 90 per cent of oil resources for the development of the Niger Delta region.

A report monitored on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BCC) yesterday quoted a western oil worker as saying that multi-national oil firms are concerned about the security situation following the threats by the Ijaw militants.


The NDVF last week warned that unless the Federal Government concedes total control of resources in the Niger-Delta to states from the area, there would be anarchy across the country.

The leader of the NDVF Bello Aruwanbe had in an interview on the BBC stated "we (NDVF) have agreed that oil must stop flowing from the length and breath of the Niger-Delta," precisely on May 29 if the government failed to execute the demand.

In demanding the 90 per cent oil resources, the NDVF said "we must revert back to the pre-independence era where the states that generated what, get 90 per cent and pay back to the Federal Government.

Aruwanbe reiterated the earlier position of the NDVF saying, "we stand on the Kaiama declaration, resources control, self-determination within the federation."

He criticise the 13 per cent derivation released tot he oil producing states last week, adding that "this 13 per cent derivation does not meet our demand."},

IJAW YOUTHS OF THE NIGER DELTA 

BEING COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE ALL IJAW YOUTHS CONFERENCE WHICH HELD IN THE TOWN OF KAIAMA THIS 11TH DAY OF DECEMBER 1998.

 

INTRODUCTION

We, Ijaw youths drawn from over five hundred communities from over 40 clans that make up the Ijaw nation and representing 25 representative organisations met, today, in Kaiama to deliberate on the best way to ensure the continuos survival of the indigenous peoples of the Ijaw ethnic nationality of the Niger Delta within the Nigerian state.

After exhaustive deliberations, the Conference observed:

a. That it was through British colonisation that the IJAW NATION was forcibly put under the Nigerian State

b. That but for the economic interests of the imperialists, the Ijaw ethnic nationality would have evolved as a distinct and separate sovereign nation, enjoying undiluted political, economic, social, and cultural AUTONOMY.

c. That the division of the Southern Protectorate into East and West in 1939 by the British marked the beginning of the balkanisation of a hitherto territorially contiguous and culturally homogeneous Ijaw people into political and administrative units, much to our disadvantage. This trend is continuing in the balkanisation of the Ijaws into six states-Ondo, Edo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa Ibom States, mostly as minorities who suffer socio-political, economic, cultural and psychological deprivations.

d. That the quality of life of Ijaw people is deteriorating as a result of utter neglect, suppression and marginalisation visited on Ijaws by the alliance of the Nigerian state and transnational oil companies.

e. That the political crisis in Nigeria is mainly about the struggle for the control of oil mineral resources which account for over 80% of GDP, 95 %of national budget and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. From which, 65%, 75% and 70% respectively are derived from within the Ijaw nation. Despite these huge contributions, our reward from the Nigerian State remains avoidable deaths resulting from ecological devastation and military repression.

f. That the unabating damage done to our fragile natural environment and to the health of our people is due in the main to uncontrolled exploration and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas which has led to numerous oil spillages, uncontrolled gas flaring, the opening up of our forests to loggers, indiscriminate canalisation, flooding, land subsidence, coastal erosion, earth tremors etc. Oil and gas are exhaustible resources and the complete lack of concern for ecological rehabilitation, in the light of the Oloibiri experience, is a signal of impending doom for the peoples of Ijawland.

g. That the degradation of the environment of Ijawland by transnational oil companies and the Nigerian State arise mainly because Ijaw people have been robbed of their natural rights to ownership and control of their land and resources through the instrumentality of undemocratic Nigerian State legislations such as the Land Use Decree of 1978, the Petroleum Decrees of 1969 and 1991, the Lands (Title Vesting etc.) Decree No. 52 of 1993 (Osborne Land Decree), the National Inland Waterways Authority Decree No. 13 of 1997 etc.

h. That the principle of Derivation in Revenue Allocation has been consciously and systematically obliterated by successive regimes of the Nigerian state. We note the drastic reduction of the Derivation Principle from 100% (1953), 50% (1960), 45% (1970), 20% (1975) 2% (1982), 1.5% (1984) to 3% (1992 to date), and a rumored 13% in Abacha's 1995 undemocratic and unimplemented Constitution.

i. That the violence in Ijawland and other parts of the Niger Delta area, sometimes manifesting in intra and inter ethnic conflicts are sponsored by the State and transnational oil companies to keep the communities of the Niger Delta area divided, weak and distracted from the causes of their problems.

j. That the recent revelations of the looting of national treasury by the Abacha junta is only a reflection of an existing and continuing trend of stealing by public office holders in the Nigerian state. We remember the over 12 billion dollars Gulf war windfall, which was looted by Babangida and his cohorts We note that over 70% of the billions of dollars being looted by military rulers and their civilian collaborators is derived from our ecologically devastated Ijawland.

Based on the foregoing, we, the youths of Ijawland, hereby make the following resolutions to be known as the Kaiama Declaration:

1. All land and natural resources (including mineral resources) within the Ijaw territory belong to Ijaw communities and are the basis of our survival.


2. We cease to recognise all undemocratic decrees that rob our peoples/communities of the right to ownership and control of our lives and resources, which were enacted without our participation and consent. These include the Land Use Decree and The Petroleum Decree etc.


3. We demand the immediate withdrawal from Ijawland of all military forces of occupation and repression by the Nigerian State. Any oil company that employs the services of the armed forces of the Nigerian State to "protect" its operations will be viewed as an enemy of the Ijaw people. Family members of military personnel stationed in Ijawland should appeal to their people to leave the Ijaw area alone.

4..Ijaw youths in all the communities in all Ijaw clans in the Niger Delta will take steps to implement these resolutions beginning from the 30th of December, 1998, as a step towards reclaiming the control of our lives. We, therefore, demand that all oil companies stop all exploration and exploitation activities in the Ijaw area. We are tired of gas flaring; oil spillages, blowouts and being labelled saboteurs and terrorists. It is a case of preparing the noose for our hanging. We reject this labelling. Hence, we advice all oil companies staff and contractors to withdraw from Ijaw territories by the 30th December, 1998 pending the resolution of the issue of resource ownership and control in the Ijaw area of the Niger Delta


5.. Ijaw youths and Peoples will promote the principle of peaceful coexistence between all Ijaw communities and with our immediate neighbours, despite the provocative and divisive actions of the Nigerian State, transnational oil companies and their contractors. We offer a hand of friendship and comradeship to our neighbors: the Itsekiri, Ilaje, Urhobo, Isoko, Edo, Ibibio, Ogoni, Ekpeye, Ikwerre etc. We affirm our commitment to joint struggle with the other ethnic nationalities in the Niger delta area for self-determination.


6. We express our solidarity with all peoples organisations and ethnic nationalities in Nigeria and elsewhere who are struggling for self-determination and justice. In particular we note the struggle of the Oodua peoples Congress (OPC), the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (Mosop), Egi Women's Movement etc.


7. We extend our hand of solidarity to the Nigerian oil workers (NUPENG and PENGASSAN) and expect that they will see this struggle for freedom as a struggle for humanity  

8. We reject the present transition to civil rule programme of the Abubakar regime, as it is not preceded by restructuring of the Nigerian federation. The way forward is a Sovereign National Conference of equally represented ethnic nationalities to discuss the nature of a democratic federation of Nigerian ethic nationalities. Conference noted the violence and killings that characterized the last local government elections in most parts of the Niger Delta. Conference pointed out that these electoral conflicts are a manifestation of the undemocratic and unjust nature of the military transition programme. Conference affirmed therefore, that the military are incapable of enthroning true democracy in Nigeria.

9 We call on all Ijaws to remain true to their Ijawness and to work for the total liberation of our people. You have no other true home but that which is in Ijawland.

10 We agreed to remain within Nigeria but to demand and work for Self Government and resource control for the Ijaw people. Conference approved that the best way for Nigeria is a federation of ethnic nationalities. The federation should be run on the basis equality and social justice.

Finally, Ijaw youths resolve to set up the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) to coordinate the struggle of Ijaw peoples for self-determination and justice.

 Brustein and Levi the Geography of Rebellion
-- rebellion ``occurs only where insurgents calculate a high probability of success'' (467)
-- key claim:  there will be a high probability of success ``where rebels (1) are able to engage in collective action, that is, to reduce free riding among potential participants; and (2) possess relatively equal bargaining power vis-a-vis the monarch'' (467)
-- factors affecting ability to overcome free riding: primary interest is in ``communal institutions'', but other sources of ``organizational capacity'' include resources that can be used to pay selective incentives to participants or finance rebel actions, and `` a reduction in the possibility of repression'' against rebels.
-- ``Rebellions are against a state whose officials feel strong enough to impose policy changes that threaten regional insterests, and are by a group of actors that feel strong enough to mount a local defense" (471). 
-- ``In situations where the regional actors control resources on which the ruler depends to such an extent that they can wrest concessions without rebellion, rebellion is unecessary" (471).
-- Basically Olson argument about where you will have enough social cohesion to overcome free-rider problem.
-- factors affecting bargaining power: opportunities and resources of rebels
-- places where there was cooperation: openfield patterns of agriculture and upland settlements (stronger communal institutions of peasants); and areas with regional parliaments (cooperation among nobility and clergy); and cooperation between the two groups, peasants and clergy, fostered by subsistence mode of production
-- a prediction of the logic would be that there would be rebellion in mineral regions and regions with ENOUGH resources to rebel but NOT ENOUGH just to secede --- IF there is sufficient collective action capacity

	Abstract = {International peacebuilding can improve the prospects that a civil war will be resolved. Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility, the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose area is the "political space"-or effective capacity-for building peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124 post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively correlated with democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence. Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of hostility, local capacities, and international capacities.},

	Abstract = {We develop and test an economic theory of insurgency motivated by the informal literature and military
doctrine. We model a three-way contest between violent rebels, a government seeking to minimize
violence by mixing service provision and coercion, and civilians deciding whether to share information
about insurgents. We test the model using panel data from Iraq on violence against Coalition and Iraqi
forces, reconstruction spending, and community characteristics (sectarian status, socio-economic grievances,
and natural resource endowments). Our results support the theory's predictions: counterinsurgents
direct services disproportionately to predictably violent locations, and improved service provision
has reduced insurgent violence since January 2007.},

	Abstract = {Most nations have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. Yet while
civil war is central to many nations' development, it has stood at the periphery of
economics research and teaching. The past decade has witnessed a long overdue
explosion of research into war's causes and consequences. We summarize progress,
identify weaknesses, and chart a path forward. Why war? Existing theory is provocative
but incomplete, omitting advances in behavioral economics and making
little progress in key areas, like why armed groups form and cohere, or how more
than two armed sides compete. Empirical work finds that low per capita incomes
and slow economic growth are both robustly linked to civil war. Yet there is little
consensus on the most effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar
recovery. Cross-country analysis of war will benefit from more attention to causal
identification and stronger links to theory. We argue that micro-level analysis and
case studies are also crucial to decipher war's causes, conduct, and consequences.
We bring a growth theoretic approach to the study of conflict consequences to highlight
areas for research, most of all the study of war's impact on institutions. We
conclude with a plea for new and better data.},

show that Africa has had a similar incidence of civil conflict to other developing regions, and, with minor
exceptions, its conflicts are consistent with the global pattern of behavior. However, the structure of risk differs
considerably from other regions. Africa's economic characteristics have made it more vulnerable to
conflict, but this has been offset by social characteristics that make its societies atypically safe. The contrasting
trends of conflict are analyzed: rising in Africa and declining in other regions. Results show that these

@article{Collier:2004,
	Abstract = {This article explores empirically the duration of civil war. It relates the duration of civil war to two
alternative models of conflict and culls testable hypotheses from the case study literature on civil war.
Using a comprehensive dataset on large-scale violent civil conflicts covering the 1960--2000 period, a
wide range of hypotheses are tested by means of hazard function regressions. The results show that the
duration of conflict is systematically related both to structural conditions prevailing prior to conflict
and to circumstances during conflict. The key structural characteristics that lengthen conflict are low
per capita income, high inequality and a moderate degree of ethnic division. The key variable characteristics
that shorten conflict are a decline in the prices of the primary commodities that the country
exports and external military intervention on the side of the rebels. Furthermore, the results indicate
that the chances of peace were much lower in the 1980s and 1990s than they had been previously.
Three empirical explanations are suggested as different approaches to civil war: rebellion-as-investment,
in which the critical incentive is the post-conflict payoff; rebellion-as-business, in which the critical
incentive is the payoff during conflict; and rebellion-as-mistake, in which military optimism prevents
the recognition of any mutually advantageous settlement. The article concludes that the empirical evidence
is incompatible with the first of these approaches but consistent with the others.},

and the opportunity cost of joining armed groups. In contrast, a rise in oil prices in-
creased violence di¤erentially in the oil region, by increasing municipal revenue siphoned
through rapacity. This pattern holds in several other agricultural and natural resource
sectors, providing robust evidence that price shocks a¤ect conict in opposite directions

	Abstract = {This article attempts to explain the determinants of the probability of willingness to join rebel groups
by youths in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, using primary data from a sample of 1,337 individuals
drawn from 18 communities. A cardinal objective is to test the theoretical explanations of the motivation
for rebellion in resource-based societies and to examine the kind of factors that present rebel opportunity.
Fifteen variables are used to reflect motives and opportunity for rebellion, and a logit regression
model is employed to estimate the probability of willingness to participate. While grievance appears to
be pervasive among individuals- and is systemically explained by the data, it is not seen to have high statistical
effect on the probability of having a disposition to rebel participation. Rather, individual-and
community-level factors that reduce the opportunity cost and risk of participation, or increase the perceived
benefits, appear to be more important. The findings suggest that strategies to achieve long-lasting
civil peace in Nigeria's Delta must go beyond grievance to address individual-level factors that determine
the opportunity cost of participation in violence, such as low income level and low educational
attainment, and community-level factors that create an opportunity to profit from extreme forms of
civil disobedience, such as low infrastructure. Some of these strategies choices are found also to have
the potential to address grievance.},

	Abstract = {Studies of natural resource wealth and civil war have been hampered
by measurement error, endogeneity, lack of robustness, and uncertainty about causal
mechanisms. This paper develops new measures and new tests to address these problems.
It has four main findings. First, the likelihood of civil war in countries that
produce oil, gas, and diamonds rose sharply from the early 1970s to the late 1990s; so
did the number of rebel groups that sold contraband to raise money. Second, exogenous
measures of oil, gas, and diamond wealth are robustly correlated with the onset of civil
war. Still, these correlations are based on a small number of cases, and the substantive
effects of resource wealth are sensitive to certain assumptions. Third, petroleum and
diamond production lead to civil wars through at least three different mechanisms.
Finally, the only resource variable robustly linked to conflict duration is a measure of
``contraband,'' which includes gemstones, timber, and narcotics.},

	Abstract = {This article proposes a political economy of extraction framework that explains
political order and state collapse as alternative outcomes in the face of lootable
wealth. Different types of institutions of extraction can be built on lootable
resources---with divergent effects on political stability. If rulers are able to
forge institutions of extraction that give them control of revenues generated by
lootable resources, then these resources can contribute to political order by providing
the income with which to govern. Conversely, the breakdown or absence
of such institutions increases the risk of civil war by making it easier for rebels
to organize. The framework is used to explain two puzzling cases that experienced
sharply contrasting political trajectories in the face of lootable resources:
Sierra Leone and Burma. A focus on institutions of extraction provides a
stronger understanding of the wide range of political outcomes---from chaos,
to dictatorship, to democracy---in resource-rich countrie},

@article{Stanley:1990,
	Abstract = {Taxes and royalties from the oil industry in Nigeria have made possible massive
infrastructural and social development throughout the country; this single industry continues
to be the most important contributor to the national treasury. Along with oil, however,
have come environmental and social problems, some severe and, in the social sector, possibly
of long duration. Questionnaires were employed to solicit environmental and socioeconomic
information from residents in the oil-impacted area as well as to ascertain the views of the oil
companies with respect to their Nigerian operations, in particular to their socio-economic
responsibilities to the local residents. Responses point to serious discontent on the part of the
impacted population, especially in the most important southern (Niger Delta) oil producing
region. These negative attitudes in part are based upon the impacted population's inability to
secure for itself a sufficiently large number of oil industry jobs and in part to the presence in
the local community of ethnic strangers who do have such employment. There is evidence of
serious environmental damage, but its biological dimension has been overshadowed by claims
for monetary compensation at the local level. Data derived from these investigations might
well be applicable in the wider field of trans-national mining and petroleum extraction operations
in developing countries, especially to the unwritten social obligations of the expatriate
firm to local residents.},
